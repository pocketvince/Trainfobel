## Extra info
Trainfobel was my first twitter bot based on Google Sheets and IFTTT automation.
I realized that a lot of sncb-related twitter bots were doing the same thing, and I finally decided to abandon this bot to make others based on shell & python.
The twitter api having become limited, all services such as Zapier, IFTTT,... have become payware, and there are no more bot dedicated to that on Twitter, I thought, it's the opportunity to start something new with my new knowledge.
